# A Jazz Artists Visualization ðŸŽ·

## Description:

### Brief:
An exploration in how closely related jazz artists are through network graph visualization. This project uses nodes to represent individual artists, clustering them based on the number of albums they have collaborated on together. Node size is determined by Google search data on each artist from the last 5 years, with bigger nodes representing higher searches. Nodes are colored by their [modularity class](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modularity_(networks)).

### Data Generation:
Node and edge lists were constructed from personnel listings on over 4000 unique albums. This project used [BeautifulSoup](https://pypi.org/project/beautifulsoup4/) to handle all web scraping.

You can view the node and edge lists used to create this visualization in the `data` folder of the repository.

## Results:

## References:

This project was inspired by the project ["Visualizing Twitch Communities"](https://github.com/KiranGershenfeld/VisualizingTwitchCommunities) by Kiran Gershenfeld.

## How to Build the Project:

I have included the node and edge lists used to create the graph in the data folder. However, if you wish to build out the data set programmatically, follow the instructions below.

### Instructions:
1. Run env_config.sh to set up the python virtual environment and install necessary dependencies
2. Run build.sh to execute all necessary python scripts. **This will take a while, the data generation process is LENGTHY.**
3. Check out the new files created in the `data` folder

## Project Dependencies / Tools Used:
* [pandas (python library)](https://pandas.pydata.org/): Data analysis / manipulation
* [BeautifulSoup (python library)](https://pypi.org/project/beautifulsoup4/): Web scraping
* [Gephi](https://gephi.org/): Data Visualization
